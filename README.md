#Movie Trailer Website 

The movie trailer website is a simple python coded file, it lets people see a few of my personal favorite movies. It uses a class, a def, class variables, constructors, instane methods(self), etc. There are three files, imported onto one(media.py file which holds the class, entertainment.py a seperate file for the instances, and a fresh_tomatoes.py for the desgin and functionality)

##Documentation

You can take a look at the [Python Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/), for a descriptions of all the built in functions python has.

##Installion 

To get this code up and running i suggest that you download [Pyhton 2.7] (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) to have access to their libraries, so you don't run into any problems trying to import things that aren't downloaded onto your computer.

I also recommend downloading the [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) file for the design, and functionality of the website(make sure that all your files for the website are saved into the same folder, or else you'll have complications). Or, you can start from scrath and do your own thing!

If you need further assitance, i would take a look at the [Programming Foundation with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud036-nd/l-990110642/m-3625658739), lesson 3a,  a class that Udacity offers.
